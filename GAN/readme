#####Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

GANs have been defined as the most interesting idea in the last 10 years in ML (https:/ / www.
quora. com/ What- are- some- recent- and- potentially- upcoming- breakthroughs- in- deeplearning)
by Yann LeCun, one of the fathers of Deep Learning. 

GANs are able to learn how to reproduce synthetic data which looks real. 
For instance, computers can learn how to paint and create realistic images. 
The idea was originally proposed by Ian Goodfellow who worked with the 
University of Montreal, Google Brain, and recently with OpenAI 
(https://openai.com/ ).
